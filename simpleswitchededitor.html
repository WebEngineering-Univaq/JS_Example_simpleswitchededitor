WEB EGINEERING COURSE - University of L'Aquila 

This example shows how form fields can be changed to static texts which
become editable only by clicking an edit button. This technique
allows to protect form data from unwanted modification. The server
receives the form data as they were sent by the original form
controls.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="simpleswitchededitor.js">
    </script>
    <style type="text/css">.edit-button { margin: 0 5px; }
    .switched-static { border-bottom: 1px solid #CDCDCD; }</style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="sezione">Alternative input controls</h1>
    <p>In this example the script converts all input controls,
    except for those with the 
    <i>nonswitched</i>class, into static texts whose value can only
    be changed by clicking on their edit icon. This approach is
    useful for protecting the controls from accidental changes.</p>
    <p>Nothing changes in the submission process: the server will
    still receive the data as if they came from the original input
    controls ( indeed this is just what happens "behind the
    scenes"). If the script is not executed, the document shows
    normal input controls.</p>
    <form method="get" action="#">
      <p>Example 1: this is an input control 
      <input name="pippo1" type="text" value="Value1" /></p>
      <p>Example 2: this is an input control 
      <input name="pippo2" type="text" value="Value2" /></p>
      <p>Example 3: this is an input control with "nonswitched"
      class 
      <input name="pippo3" class="nonswitched" type="text"
      value="Value3" /></p>
      <p>
        <input name="ok" type="submit" value="Send" />
      </p>
    </form>
  </body>
